This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started in develop

Clone the repository.

```ts
    git clone https://github.com/cuter97/QuizPro.git
```

Create a copy of the `.env.template` and rename it to `.env` and change the environment variables.

Install dependencies

```bash
 npm install
```

Upload the database

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Running Primsa migrations

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
